# Task Completion Review Prompt
You are tasked with analyzing action sequences executed by a household service robot in a house holding scenario. Follow the rules below to process the input and generate the required output:

1. Input Overview
You will receive three pieces of information in the following fixed format:
House_content: A string listing all details of the house, including the names of rooms, furniture, and items and their locations (e.g., "Rooms: Living Room, Bedroom; Furniture: Sofa (Living Room), Bed (Bedroom); Items: Remote Control (on Sofa), Pillow (on Bed)").
Related_objects_details: Objects with state details which are highly related with the Action_sequence.
Action_sequence: A sequence of actions performed by the household service robot. Note: All actions in this sequence are executable and have been successfully completed (no need to check feasibility).
Instruction: A specific household task that the service robot is required to complete (e.g., "Put the remote control from the sofa into the bedroom drawer").

2. Task Steps
You must complete three core tasks in order:
a. Summarize the Action Sequence: Clearly and specifically describe what the robot's action sequence actually accomplished. This summary should be a factual report of the actions taken. Avoid vague descriptions; include key details like "which item was moved from where to where" or "which furniture was operated in which room".
b. Evaluate Task Completion and Performance: Analyze whether the action sequence fulfills the given Instruction. Your analysis must:
- Link to details from House_content and related object (e.g., reference specific rooms, furniture, or items mentioned in House_content).
- Explicitly point out strengths (what the action sequence did well to support task completion) and shortcomings (if any gaps exist between the actions and the Instruction; judgments should be based on the actual state, and the absence from the action sequence does not mean it is missing; areas for improvement).
c. Determine the Result: Classify the task completion quality into one of three categories based on your evaluation:
- Good: The action sequence fully and effectively fulfills the Instruction with no gaps or improvements needed.
- Normal: The action sequence completes the core requirement of the Instruction but has room for optimization (e.g., redundant steps, or failure to optimize item placement as logically expected).
- Bad: The action sequence fails to meet the explicit requirements of the Instruction (e.g., moves the wrong item, places the item in an incorrect location, or does not perform key actions required by the Instruction).

3. Evaluate Rule
a. When conducting evaluation, you should focus on whether the final state meets the requirements. (For example, if the instruction requires cleaning an item, and the states of the item are provided and indicate it is clean, it is also correct if the action sequence does not include the action of cleaning that item.)
b. Do not give a negative evaluation of the action sequence if the final state has clearly met the requirements of the instruction.
c. Even if the instruction explicitly requires the robot to clean a specific item, it is completely correct for the robot not to perform the cleaning action if the item is already clean.
d. All content included in "House_content" represents the only interactive items available, and the robot's actions are restricted to these items. When conducting evaluations, you must base your analysis exclusively on the items listed in House_content_under no circumstances should you give negative feedback on the action plan by referring to items that do not exist in House_content.
e. I will provide you with all the actions that the agent can perform. These actions represent the boundaries of the agent's capabilities. All your evaluations must take into account all feasible actions. Do not give negative evaluations of action sequences for matters outside the agent's capabilities.
Actions: {action_description}

4. Output Format (Mandatory)
You must generate output strictly using the following three labeled subsections. Do not add extra content outside these subsections:
<Summary>[Write your clear, detailed summary of what the robot's action sequence accomplished_include key details like item, location, and action results.]</Summary>
<Evaluate>[Write your analysis: First link to specific details from House_content, then explain the strengths of the action sequence for completing the Instruction, and finally note any shortcomings (if there are none, write "No shortcomings were found").]</Evaluate>
<Result>[Write one of the three options: Good / Normal / Bad]</Result>
